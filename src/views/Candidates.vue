                Born in China, Song Yang came to Montreal with his parents at the age of 8 in 2004. He enrolled in the Bill 101 schooling system in French and then attended Marianopolis and graduated in Computer Science at McGill. Currently, Yang is studying a Master’s at University of Montreal in the same topic.
                <br />
                <br />When the pandemic hit, Yang set aside his desire to explore the world. 2020 was a politically active year for him. The state of the world is at a crisis point and yet Quebec was going full-on on identity politics.
                <br />
                <br />
                <i>Enough! COVID is raging, the planet is burning. Yet, all Quebec cares about is secularism and French?</i>
                <br />
                <br />Freedom of religion and freedom of speech are under attack by Quebec nationalism. When the Bloc Quebecois began a campaign on “Bonjour-Ho” because “Bonjour-Hi” was too offensive, it tipped Yang from activist to politician.
                <br />
                <br />Yang thinks Quebec identity is comical on the surface, but going unchallenged is dangerous for Quebec. The federalist Liberals are cowering under the pressure of polls --not the first time in history-- and the ideologically-rigid QS cannot divorce its pro-separation stance from its nationalist identity. Yang believes this is the time for a new party.
                <br />
                <br />The Universal Party cannot afford to ignore identity politics in Quebec by pretending it doesn’t matter like the Quebec Conservative Party. Yang wants to tackle identity politics directly. Silence never solves the problem. It allows your opponents to keep doing what they want.
                <br />
                <br />With his expertise in the influencial field of Computer Science, Yang brings the perspective of a digital world powered by the Internet to Quebec. Almost a quarter into the 21st century, government services act like we are still in the 1990s. Yang believes if Quebec wants to stay relevant in the world, the province needs to adapt quickly to the modern reality.
