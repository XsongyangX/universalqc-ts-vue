        The Universal Party is a provincial political party in Quebec, Canada. The idea for the party started in 2020 by Song Yang.
        <br />
        <br />The party aims to be a full-on party that tackles all issues from a consistent ideology centered around individual rights and a left-of-center policy guideline.
        <br />
        <br />Although inspired by the late Equality Party, the Universal Party is not a one-issue party nor a Liberal protest party. We will never merge with the Liberal establishment.
